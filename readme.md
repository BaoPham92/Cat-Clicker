## Todo's

- Aug 3rd. ~~Logic created to check for h4's in figure element, need to create and adjuts clicks accordingly to number of clicks per photo.~~ (**)

- August 8th. After juggling work and many attempts, I finally created a future proof code so far that if __ANY__ new additions of images are added for click targets with the same class, all data is generated automatically for the images. (Honestly, looking back I could have done things in a much simpler fashion updating one code at a time with methods that are less complicated.)
